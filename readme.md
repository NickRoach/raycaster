#Raycaster

A graphics engine in the style of Doom and Wolfenstein 3D

Men will literally write a graphics engine from scratch instead of going to therapy

I purposely didn't do any research on how to do this, putting myself in the shoes of John Carmack in ca. 1990 when he wrote the engine for
Wolfenstein 3D. I had seen a tutorial on making a raycaster engine in C++ about a year ago, but that's it. I only looked up Javascript features and trigonometry (high school was a long time ago).
I used procedural code only - no classes - and I don't regret it. I am yet to feel the need to encapsulate logic and data together in a class

#In a nutshell:

Scanning from left to right across the field of view, algorithms locate the nearest intersect with a solid block. A vertical line is drawn
in the rendering view with a height corresponding to the distance of that intersect.

#Try it out:

`npm i` to install packages

`npm start` to transpile, weback and start live server

Mac and Linux users will likely run into problems with the use of 'concurrently' in the 'npm start' script, but that shouldn't be too hard to work out.
